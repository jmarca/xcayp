It could be summarized as a pouch app. A web app that can be customized in browser, everywhere where pouchdb(https://github.com/daleharvey/pouchdb) is supported. A skeleton is provided that connects to the source DBs, interface objects are downloaded locally from source DBs and revived live.


Goal is simple: create a robust common library where participants may drop custom interfaces that they feel would be useful to the community.
